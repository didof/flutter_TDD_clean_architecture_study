# TDD_clean_architecture

This project have been built following the [Reso Coder tutorial](https://resocoder.com/flutter-clean-architecture-tdd/).

This sandbox application allow the user to retrieve number trivia from an API, both in concrete and casual mode.
It is built according to the *Domain Driven Design* pattern and also implements *Test Driven Design*. It will serve as an _aryan thread_ during my puzzling with this very interesting topic.
